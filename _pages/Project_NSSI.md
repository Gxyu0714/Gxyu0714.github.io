### Overview

This project explores the **factors and pathways leading to non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI)** in children using computational causal analysis. The research integrates machine learning and causal inference methods to uncover the intricate causal relationships behind NSSI behaviors, with a specific focus on the COVID-19 pandemic’s impact.

### Methodology

- **Data Source**: **Chengdu Positive Child Development (CPCD)** survey, a school-based longitudinal study with 5,807 participants aged 6–16 years.
- **Techniques Used**:
  - **Causal Discovery**: PC, FCI, and Graphical Autoencoder (GAE) methods.
  - **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)**: Visualized causal relationships influencing NSSI.
- **Data Preprocessing**:
  - Standardized numerical features.
  - Encoded categorical variables for causal model compatibility.

### Key Contributions

#### Highlights:
- **Causal Discovery**: Applied PC, FCI, and GAE methods to identify nine pivotal factors directly related to NSSI.
- **COVID-19 Impact**: Analyzed the role of pandemic-induced changes in behavior and mental health.
- **Intervention Strategies**: Identified key pathways for targeted prevention and intervention.

#### Direct Causes Identified:
1. Life satisfaction
2. Depression
3. Family dysfunction
4. Sugary beverage consumption
5. Positive Youth Development (PYD)
6. Internet addiction
7. COVID-19-related PTSD
8. Academic anxiety
9. Sleep duration

#### Four Principal Pathways:
1. Lockdown-induced lifestyle changes increasing academic anxiety and internet addiction.
2. Enhanced screen time and sugary beverage consumption linked to depression.
3. PYD buffering adverse effects of family dysfunction on NSSI.
4. Family dysfunction reducing life satisfaction and fostering depression.

### Results

- **Prevalence**:
  - 26.27% of children reported engaging in NSSI within the past year.
  - Female students (27.75%) had a higher NSSI rate than male students (24.82%).
- **Key Findings**:
  - Lockdowns disrupted sleep and physical activity patterns, heightening academic stress.
  - Positive Youth Development emerged as a protective factor, mitigating NSSI risk.
