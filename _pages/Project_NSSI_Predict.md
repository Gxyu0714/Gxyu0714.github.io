### Research Overview

This research project investigates how life changes brought by the COVID-19 pandemic affected the mental health of Chinese children and adolescents. By combining cross-sectional, longitudinal, and clustering methods, the study provides a comprehensive analysis of depressive and anxiety symptoms before, during, and after the lockdown.

### Key Highlights

#### **Study Design**
- Analyzed survey data from **7,829 students** (Grades 1–9) across **three waves** (Dec 2019 – Jul 2021).
- Combined **cross-sectional** and **longitudinal** approaches to assess short- and long-term mental health effects.
- Conducted clustering analysis to identify distinct patterns of life changes (e.g., social, lifestyle, and family financial dimensions).

### Methods
- **Data Collection**: Surveys included measures for:
  - Life changes (e.g., social activities, diet, screen time, and financial stability).
  - Mental health symptoms using the CES-D (depression) and SCARED (anxiety) scales.
- **Statistical Analysis**:
  - Logistic regression models to determine associations.
  - Clustering using Gower’s distance for multidimensional life change patterns.


#### **Findings**
- **Mental Health Trends**: The prevalence of depressive and anxiety symptoms slightly decreased overall during the pandemic, but:
  - Negative impacts on study, social, and outdoor activities, as well as dietary changes, correlated with **increased mental health risks**.
  - Severe family income declines showed a **sustained impact** on depressive symptoms.
- **Clustering Patterns**: Identified four distinct groups based on life change patterns:
  - Stable
  - Severe financial impact
  - Severe social impact
  - Moderate social impact

The findings highlight the profound psychological effects of pandemic restrictions on youth and emphasize the need for:
- Tailored interventions targeting children and adolescents in similar public health crises.
- Policies addressing financial vulnerabilities and promoting stable social and lifestyle routines for better mental health outcomes.
