    <p>My interest in surgical robotics began through a podcast introduction to the Da Vinci surgical robot. I was particularly impressed by its minimally invasive capabilities and the significantly reduced patient recovery times it enabled. Although this technology field was completely unrelated to my undergraduate studies, my graduate background in Health Policy and Management sparked my curiosity about how these advanced medical technologies navigate China's complex regulatory landscape.</p>

    <p>I became interested in understanding the approval processes that allow surgical robots to enter Chinese hospitals. This intersection of cutting-edge technology and healthcare policy presented a unique opportunity to contribute meaningful analysis to the industry. As Chinese companies like Tinavi began entering the orthopedic robotics market, I recognized the growing need for comprehensive policy analysis that could benefit both manufacturers and healthcare institutions.</p>

    <p>Working with surgical robotics has expanded my understanding of healthcare policy as a comprehensive field. The healthcare industry requires carefully designed policies that balance innovation encouragement with patient safety protection. Through this work, I have learned that effective healthcare policies must adapt to each region's unique characteristics, as regulatory frameworks successful in one country may not be suitable for another's healthcare infrastructure or cultural context.</p>

    <p>This experience has demonstrated how policy analysis in healthcare extends beyond individual technologies to encompass entire ecosystems of innovation, regulation, market access, and patient care delivery. My role allows me to combine policy expertise with emerging healthcare technologies while helping stakeholders understand complex regulatory pathways that can accelerate the adoption of beneficial surgical technologies and improve patient outcomes across China's healthcare system.</p>
