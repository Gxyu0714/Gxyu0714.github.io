The Chinese General Social Survey (CGSS) [website](http://cgss.ruc.edu.cn/English/Home.htm) is a comprehensive project aimed at understanding the relationship between social structure and quality of life across urban and rural areas in China. In 2023, I co-led the Sichuan survey team, focusing on gathering critical insights through detailed fieldwork and analysis.

### Objectives
The primary goal of the 2023 CGSS project is to:
1. Assess the impact of urbanization on residents' quality of life.
2. Understand the disparities between urban and rural social structures.
3. Provide policy recommendations based on empirical data.
